If you don't already have one in your subscription, you'll need to provision an Azure AI Language service resource in your Azure subscription.

Open the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com, and sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription


pip install azure-ai-textanalytics==5.3.0
pip install python-dotenv

Update the configuration values to include the endpoint and a key from the Azure Language resource you created (available on the Keys and Endpoint page for your Azure AI Language resource in the Azure portal)
